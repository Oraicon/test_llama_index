Gundam is a popular Japanese franchise that primarily focuses on giant robots, or mecha, piloted by humans in a militaristic or space-centered setting. The Gundam series was created by Yoshiyuki Tomino and the animation studio Sunrise in 1979, starting with the anime Mobile Suit Gundam. The series revolutionized the mecha genre by introducing more realistic and militarized robots, known as "mobile suits," rather than the superhero-like robots common in earlier anime.

Key Features of Gundam:
Mobile Suits: Giant, humanoid robots designed for combat. The titular "Gundam" mobile suits are usually elite, high-performance models with advanced weapons, armor, and systems.
Realistic Warfare: Gundam stands out for its depiction of war, politics, and the ethical dilemmas of conflict. The battles are portrayed with strategic realism, making it more of a "military sci-fi" than simple action.
Space Colonies and Politics: The stories often revolve around Earth and various space colonies, with conflict brewing between the colonies and Earth’s governing body, touching on themes of rebellion, oppression, and independence.
Multiple Timelines: Gundam has different universes or timelines (e.g., Universal Century, Cosmic Era, Future Century), each with its own storylines, mobile suits, and characters. Universal Century (UC) is the original and most detailed timeline.
Iconic Characters: The franchise features well-known characters like Amuro Ray and Char Aznable who appear throughout many series within the Universal Century timeline.
Gunpla (Gundam Plastic Models): A significant part of the franchise is the hobby of building and collecting Gundam model kits, known as Gunpla, which are loved by fans worldwide. These plastic models vary in size, detail, and complexity, with some being highly customizable.
